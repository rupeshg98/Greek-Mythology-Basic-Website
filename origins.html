    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p> Walter Burkert suggests that the archaic groups or societies of lesser gods mirror real cult associations: "It
        may be surmised that smith guilds lie behind Cabeiri, Idaian Dactyloi, Telchines, and Cyclopes." Burkert also
        suggests that because cyclops are at times portrayed as blacksmiths, the legend of their single eye may have
        arisen from the practice of blacksmiths wearing an eyepatch over one eye to prevent flying sparks from blinding
        them in both eyes. The cyclopes seen in Homer's Odyssey are of a different type from those in the
        Theogony and they have no connection to blacksmithing. It is possible that independent legends associated with
        Polyphemus did not make him a cyclops before Homer's Odyssey; Polyphemus may have been some sort of local
        daemon or monster in original stories.

        Another possible origin for the cyclops legend, advanced by the paleontologist Othenio Abel in 1914, is the
        prehistoric dwarf elephant skulls - about twice the size of a human skull - that may have been found by the
        Greeks on Cyprus, Crete, Malta and Sicily. Abel suggested that the large, central nasal cavity (for the trunk)
        in the skull might have been interpreted as a large single eye-socket. Given the inexperience of the locals
        with living elephants, they were unlikely to recognize the skull for what it actually was.

        Others have questioned the influence of elephant skulls on the origins of the cyclops legend. Adrienne Mayor
        disagrees with the theory that prehistoric dwarf elephant skulls were supposedly discovered by the ancient
        Greek philosopher Empedocles. According to some sources, Empedocles mistook the skulls for cyclops bones, and
        this was apparently later reported by the Italian Renaissance author Boccaccio. The story is not accepted as
        factual, in part because Empedocles in his surviving writings never mentions skulls, or cyclops, or even
        elephants, which were unknown to Greeks at the time; and because Boccaccio never mentions Empedocles in this
        regard. The Boccaccio reference was added to the story in 1940 by the speculations of another author.

        Veratrum album, or white hellebore, an herbal medicine used by Ancient Greeks and described by Hippocrates
        before 400 BC, contains the alkaloids cyclopamine and jervine, which are teratogens capable of causing
        cyclopia and holoprosencephaly, severe birth defects in which a fetus can be born with a single eye. Students
        of teratology have raised the possibility of a link between this developmental deformity in Ancient Greek
        infants and the myth for which it was named. Regardless of the connection between the herb and the birth
        abnormalities, it is possible these rare birth defects may have contributed to the myth. However, a study of
        deformed humans born with a single eye all have a nose above the single eye, not below.</p>
