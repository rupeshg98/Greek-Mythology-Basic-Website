    <p> The Cyclopes were known for their great strength, and also their ability of craftsmanship. They created Zeus'
        lightning bolts, in return for freeing them, while he was fighting the Titans. They also forged Poseidon's
        trident. They were also known for going around eating humans. They worked as Hephaestus helpers under the
        volcano Etna making Zeus's lightnings, but were killed by Apollo as a revenge for Zeus's killing his son
        Aclepius.</p>
