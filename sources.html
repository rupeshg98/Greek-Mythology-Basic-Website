    <p> It is often assumed that Polyphemus lives, along with the other cyclopes, on an island. That is a possibility
        but all that is known from Homer’s Odyssey is that Polyphemus resided in a “land” somewhere farther on from the
        Lotus-Eaters, in a place that is not close or distant from an uninhabited, wooded and unexploited island, where
        Odysseus arrives. The map location that can be drawn from this episode and the surrounding episodes in the
        Odyssey is variously described and discussed divergently by scholars.

        Euripides in his satyr-drama, Cyclops, appears at times to follow closely the story found in Homer, and at
        other times contributes variations. In Euripides' play there is no mention of the unexploited island, and
        Euripides keeps the action of the play in one location — the place where the cyclopes live, and where Odysseus’
        ship landed. Euripides also makes a significant variation from Homer to the setting: he imagines the location
        to be Mount Etna “where the one-eyed sons of the sea god, the man-slaying Cyclopes, live in their desolate
        caves.”

        Another source for the story of Polyphemus is Idyll XI. The Cyclops by Theocritus (circa 270 BC), in which the
        cyclopes’ home is, following Euripides, near Mount Etna in Sicily. Since Euripides and Theocritus the
        Sicilian location has become attached to the cyclops story.</p>
