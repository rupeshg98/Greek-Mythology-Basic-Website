    <h1 id = "Maintitle">Cyclops</h1>
    <p> The Cyclopes (singular: Cyclops) were gigantic, one-eyed beings with enormous strength. Originally, there were
        three of them: Arges, Steropes, and Brontes; capable blacksmiths, these were the sons of Uranus and Gaea and
        the brothers of the Hecatoncheires and the Titans. They were imprisoned by Cronus but released by his son Zeus,
        for whom they forged his famous thunderbolt as a sign of gratitude. However, at a later time, poets spoke of a
        different type of Cyclopes, a race of dim-witted and violent one-eyed shepherds dwelling in the caves of the
        island of Sicily. The most famous among them was Polyphemus, the Cyclops who fell in love with Galatea and was
        eventually blinded by Odysseus.</p>
